## 2026-06-09 - Adding 'Clear Search' to OutlinedTextField
**Learning:** Used a `trailingIcon` conditionally inside Jetpack Compose's `OutlinedTextField` to only show a 'Clear' (`IconButton` + `Close` icon) when the query is not empty. Added proper `contentDescription` to improve screen reader accessibility.
**Action:** When implementing searchable inputs in Compose, remember to include conditionally rendered clear buttons with descriptive ARIA-like labels.
